Compilers and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
========================================================

## Compilers

The course focuses on the C language. The reference is **C11** ([ISO/IEC 9899:2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision))), as the **C18** ([ISO/IEC 9899:2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C18_(C_standard_revision))) did not introduce new features. Valid compilers include recent [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/).

**Note:** Microsoft Visual Studio's compiler does not fully conform with the current ISO/IEC standard.

## IDEs

### Code::Blocks

* Site: [http://codeblocks.org/](http://codeblocks.org/).

Free, open source, cross platform IDE for C, C++, and Fortran. Some setup packages with *mingw* in their name include a *gcc* compiler, but a compiler could also be added at a later time.

Code::Blocks runs on most Windows and Linux boxes, but several problems have been reported on Mac's, especially the newest ones. Available in all Politecnico labs.

### CodeLite

* Site: [http://www.codelite.org/](http://www.codelite.org/).

Free, open source, cross platform IDE for C, C++, PHP, and Node.js. Compiler and debugger must be downloaded separately.

CodeLite runs smoothly with all recent Windows (7, 8, 10), Mac OS X, Linux. Not available in Politecnico labs.

### XCode

* Site: [https://developer.apple.com/xcode/](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

The official IDE from Apple, available for free. Extremely powerful, with tons of features that will not be used in the course. It only works on Mac computers.

**Note**: Installing XCode could be required to get a working C compiler on a Mac box, even if you plan to use CodeLite.

### VisualStudio

* Site: [https://www.visualstudio.com/](https://www.visualstudio.com/)

The official IDE from Microsoft. Available in a multitude of versions, some free. Extremely powerful, with tons of features that will not be used in the course. It only works with Microsoft OS. The C compiler is not fully compliant with the ISO/IEC standard.

### Online IDEs

* Site: [https://www.codechef.com/ide](https://www.codechef.com/ide)
* Site: [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_c_online.php](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_c_online.php)

Several sites are offering free, online IDEs for C. They may be useful to check code on-the-fly from a portable device.
