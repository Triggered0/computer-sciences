# CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION ANALYSIS -- EVALUATION GRID

## BASIC PYTHON: 4

* Check `__name__` and use of `main()`: 2 point
* Coherent naming (`GLOBAL_SYMBOLS` + either all `snake_case` or all `camelCase`): 1
* No global symbols except for the so-called *constants*: 1

## INPUT/OUTPUT: 10

* Correct open/close for all files (either `with` or a clean `.close()` in *all* possible branches, including except): 2
* Use of `try / except` in all files: 2
* Use of the correct `OSError` exception: 1
* Parsing ans storing of `consumptions.txt` (in any suitable data structure): 1
* Parsing ans storing of `systems.txt` (in any suitable data structure): 1
* Parsing ans storing of `weather.txt` (in any suitable data structure): 1
* Correct printing of any required information: 1
* Correct printing of all required information in the correct format: 1

## ALGORITHM: 12

* Correct calculation of the *produced energy* for at least one household in at least one time instant: 1
* Correct calculation of all *produced energy* for all households in all time instants: 1
* Correct calculation of the *energy fed into the grid* for at least one household in at least one time instant: 1
* Correct calculation of all *energy fed into the grid* for all households in all time instants: 1
* Correct calculation of the *self-consumed energy* for at least one household in at least one time instant: 1
* Correct calculation of all *self-consumed energy* for all households in all time instants: 1
* Correct calculation of the aggregate *total consumption*: 1
* Correct calculation of the aggregate *self-consumed energy*: 1
* Correct calculation of the aggregate *produced energy*: 1
* Correct calculation of the aggregate *energy fed into the grid*: 1
* Correct calculation of the aggregate *self-consumption*: 1
* Correct calculation of the aggregate *self-sufficiency*: 1
