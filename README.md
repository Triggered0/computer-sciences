Computer Sciences
=================

This repo contains old exams, notes, and all the code fragments developed during my lectures of *Computer Sciences* at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/?lang=en).

Please note that the course switched from C to Python:
* Up to 2019/20 the code starts with **04JCJ** and students should refer to directory [C](./C)
* From 2020/21 the code starts with **07JCJ** and students should refer to directory [Python](./Python)
